<body>
	This is a basic html page. Content goes here. Why this text is
	displayed on the same line? Also, why all the spaces are not displayed?
	HTML is about meaning, non presentation. The browser will remove extra
	spaces and extra lines. If you want a line break, you should explicitly
	state that using &lt;br&gt;

	<br>
	<br>
	<br> which will create a line break.
	<br> Spaces     can be introduced with     "non breaking spaces"
	entities, or better in CSS.
	<br> Using &lt;br&gt; is not great, we should organize the content
	using for instance
	<a href="paragraph.html">paragraph</a>, along with
	<a href="containing">container elements</a> like &lt;div&gt; and
	&lt;span&gt;
